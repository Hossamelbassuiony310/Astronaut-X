# Interactive Orrery Web App for Kids

## Overview
The **Interactive Orrery Web App** is designed to make space exploration exciting and accessible for children. By addressing the common challenges kids face when learning about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)—such as technical terminology and abstract concepts—the app provides a fun, interactive way to explore the solar system. Through engaging visuals and simple explanations, young users can discover the wonders of space.

## Problem
Learning about NEOs can be challenging for children due to complex terms like "asteroid" and "comet," as well as the vastness of space and difficult scientific concepts. Without engaging visual aids, it’s hard for kids to grasp these ideas.

## Solution
The **Interactive Orrery Web App** solves this problem by offering an engaging, interactive platform where children can explore space. With spinning planets, animated orbits, and playful visuals, the app makes learning about NEOs fun and accessible. The educational content is tailored to young audiences, using simple language and clear visuals to explain concepts like the size, composition, and impact of NEOs on Earth.

## Key Features
- **Fun Animations**: Dynamic visuals demonstrate the movement and orbits of space objects, making the learning process enjoyable and interactive.
- **Kid-Friendly Educational Content**: Simple explanations about NEOs, covering important facts in a way that’s easy for children to understand.

## Technology Stack
- **UI/UX Design**: Figma
- **Development**: JavaScript, C#, Python

## Future Enhancements
Future updates will include **Augmented Reality (AR)** features, allowing children to bring the orrery experience into their own space, interact with NEOs, and enhance their learning experience.
